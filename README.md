# flexible-routing
Simulation code and output files to computationally assess the costs of a "flexible" vehicle routing strategy. Previously, [Ledvina et al. (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3656374) proposed an overlapped routing strategy with customer sharing which applies principles from manufacturing process flexibility to the field of vehicle routing with stochastic customer demands. In this project, we now expand on Ledvina et al. (2020)'s initial computational study.
