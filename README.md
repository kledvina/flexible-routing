# flexible-routing
Simulation code and output files to computationally assess the costs of a vehicle routing strategy with fixed routes and customer sharing. This work improves on the simulation study in the working paper by [Ledvina et al. (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3656374) and serves as supplemental files for Kirby Ledvina's masters thesis in MIT's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
